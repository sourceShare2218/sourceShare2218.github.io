        <h2>1. Quick Review of Programming Language</h2>
        <ul>
            <!-- TODO: checkbox -->
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>2. What is Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Algorithm</a> is a sequence of instructions to solve a problem. 
            An algorithm can take inputs and perform a computation, and then returns desired outputs.
        </p>
        <img src="../data/image/Algorithm.jpeg" alt="algorithm" width=500/>
        <p>
            There are well-established algorithms for simple problems like sorting and searching to complicated problems.
            An algorithm are desired to be robust, which means that it correctly works on any inputs (it would be useless
            if it works only in a restricted situation), and to be efficient.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>3. Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            Simply put,  algorithm complexity is a measure for the efficiency of the algorithm. That gives you an insight
            on how long it takes for the algorithm to perform a computation and how much memory it needs to do the job.
        </p>
            <h3>3.1 Asymptotic Analysis</h3>
            <p class="containLatex">
                In real world IT services, scales of computing can be huge and an algorithm might be repeatedly executed 
                an astronomical amount of times. So, quite often we mostly care about the relation between computation time
                and input size. For exmpample, $f(n) = n^2$ might be as big as or even better than $g(n) = 1000n$ with 
                relatively small n where each represents the time complexity of each algorithm. However, when n gets bigger 
                and bigger, then $f(n)$ becomes much worse than $g(n)$.

                The most commonly used notation is big-$O$, which is the worst case complexity. In other words, when 
                an algorithm of $O(f(n))$ is executed, the worst computation time of the algorithm is proportional to $f(n)$.
                It could be less than $f(n)$ like 1 depending on inputs, but it will never be larger than $f(n)$.
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 Algebra of Asymptotic Notations</h3>
            <p>
                n is input size and O is big-O notation
            </p>
            <ol class="containLatex">
                <li>$O(\alpha n) = O(n)$ : where $\forall\alpha > 0(\alpha \in R)$</li>
                <li>$O(f(n) + g(n)) = O(f(n))$ : where $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{g(n)}{f(n)} = 0$</li>
                <li>$O(1)$ : if the computation time is independent of input size</li>
                <li>$O(n) + O(m) = O(n + m)$</li>
                <li>$O(n) \times m = O(nm)$</li>
            </ol>
        <br>

        <h2>4. Basic Data Structures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="emphasis">Arrays</li>
                <p>a sequence of data with fixed length. the size can't be dynamically modified. And all the data 
                inside an array has to be the same type.</p>
                <img src="../data/image/Array.jpeg" alt="Array" width=500>
                <p>arrays are stored contiguously in memory</p>
            <li class="emphasis">Linked Lists</li>
                <p> a collection of data connected linearly with one another, which says that each element is connected
                    only to next or previous element, and there aren't nodes that point to multiple nodes and nodes that 
                    are pointed by more than two nodes</p>
                <img src="../data/image/LinkedList.jpeg" alt="LinkedList" width=500>
                <p> those nodes can be linked to both sides, which is a doubly linked list. </p>
                    <img src="../data/image/DoubleLinkedList.jpeg" alt="DoubleLinkedList" width=500>
            <li class="emphasis">Hash Table</li>
                <p>a container of data accessible by keys instead of indices. Hash table can take key and value strucure.</p>
                <p>Conceptually, Hash table can be thought of as an unordered collection of data in which you can search
                    a key with O(1) like below: </p>
                <img src="../data/image/HashTableSimplified.jpeg" alt="HashTableSimplified" width=500>
                <p>In its implimentation, it employs a hash function. The hash function translates a key into the corresponding
                    index($f:key\to index$: like below) so that it doesn't have to check with all the elements. Thus
                    the time complexity of searching is idially reduced to O(1). (However, that could be O(n) if there is 
                    a collisoin in worst case, but we can leave that out in usual contexts)</p>
                <img src="../data/image/HashTable.jpeg" alt="HashTable" width=500>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">So remember that you can search elements in hash table usually with O(1) 
                    whereas it takes O(n) to do it in arrays and linked lists.</p>
        </ul>
